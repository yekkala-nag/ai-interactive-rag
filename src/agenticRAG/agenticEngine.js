## 1. Eligibility & Attendance Caps
Employees in good standing may attend up to two paid industry conferences per calendar year, subject to department budget availability and manager approval.

- Standard lodging should adhere to the nightly caps outlined in travel_policy.md ($220/night domestic, $280/night international).
- Exception: When attending an approved conference where the conference organizer has negotiated an official host hotel, employees are permitted to book the official conference hotel even if the nightly rate exceeds standard city caps.
- Justification Requirement: To qualify for the official hotel exception, the employee must demonstrate a practical business benefit (e.g., proximity for networking, lack of alternative transit, or session venue integration).

## 3. Approval Workflow
- Initial manager pre-approval must be obtained prior to registering or booking flights.
- For expenditure limits and escalation thresholds exceeding $2,000 in total trip costs, refer to approval_matrix.md.
- International travel notice timelines must strictly adhere to policy_updates_2026.md.`
